## Nice-to-Know Libraries

### Advanced Tools in the Ecosystem

* **Diffusers** - Complete toolkit for image generation models like Stable Diffusion
* **PEFT** - Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) for training billion-parameter models on consumer hardware
* **TGI** (Text Generation Inference) - Production-ready serving infrastructure for deploying LLMs at scale
* **TRL** - Train models with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
* **Accelerate** - Write once, run anywhere - same code scales from 1 GPU to 100+ GPUs
* **Optimum** - Export and optimize models to ONNX format for 2-5x faster inference
